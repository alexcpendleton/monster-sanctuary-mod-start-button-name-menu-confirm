# Monster Sanctuary Mod - "Start" button selects "Confirm" button on name keyboard
A very simple quality-of-life mod. If you press your controller's "Start" button while naming a monster the "Confirm" button will be selected. I missed this behavior from other games, particularly on Switch. I've only tested this with a PS4 controller, so please let me know if this doesn't work for your controller of choice and I'll try to make it happen. :)
